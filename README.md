# git_practice_transfer
The git_practice repository that was created when the Git_book was written.

Git_practice was created as a local repository and has a git log which includes commits from 3 different local repositories, 2 personal user accounts, a fork, and a pull request/merge. This repository was **transferred** to the ADF&G-DSF account in the "Before you go!" chapter of the Git_book. Notice that the transferred repository tracks the changes associated with the pull request in its history and **retains** the GitHub specific features (In this case the documentation accompanying the pull request).
